        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 large baking potatoes</li>
                <li>8 slices of bacon</li>
                <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of milk</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
                <li>8 green onions, sliced, divided</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until tender, 
                    about 1 hour, depending on the size of your potatoes. Set potatoes aside until cool enough to handle.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. 
                    Drain, crumble, and set aside.</li>
                <li>Slice potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop the flesh 
                    into a large bowl; save skins. Add sour cream, milk, butter, salt, pepper, 1/2 cup cheese, and 1/2 of the green onions to the potato; 
                    mix with a hand mixer until well blended and creamy. Spoon the mixture into the potato skins; top each with remaining cheese, green onions, and bacon.</li>
                <li>Return potatoes to the preheated oven and continue baking until the cheese is melted, about 15 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
